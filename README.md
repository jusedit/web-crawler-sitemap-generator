# Web Crawler and Sitemap Generator

This Python script is a web crawler and sitemap generator that helps you create a sitemap for a website. It uses the Selenium web driver to navigate and extract information from web pages, and it generates an XML sitemap based on the website's structure.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the web crawler and sitemap generator:

### Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Required Python packages (install them using `pip`):
- Firefox

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Mozilla Firefox (the script uses the Firefox web driver)

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jusedit/web-crawler-sitemap-generator.git
cd web-crawler-sitemap-generator
```

2. Install the required Python packages as mentioned in the "Prerequisites" section.

3. Run the script by executing the following command:

```bash
python web_crawler.py
```

4. The script will prompt you to enter the starting URL. Provide the URL you want to start the web crawling from.

5. The sitemap will be generated and saved as `sitemap.xml` in the project directory.

6. You can view the sitemap in `sitemap.xml` or use it for your SEO needs.

### Configuration

You can configure the web crawler by modifying the `web_crawler.py` script. You can adjust parameters such as crawl depth and more according to your requirements.

## Additional Information

- The script uses the Selenium web driver, BeautifulSoup for parsing, and requests for making HTTP requests.

- The generated sitemap follows the XML sitemap protocol and includes information about each page's URL, last modification date, and priority based on the crawl depth.

- Make sure to comply with website scraping policies and obtain necessary permissions before using this tool on any website.
